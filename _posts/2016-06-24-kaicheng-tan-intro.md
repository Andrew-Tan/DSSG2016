```ruby
me = DSSG2016Participant.initialize("Kaicheng Tan")
me.assignedProject = "Open Sidewalk"
me.major = "Computer Science"
```

I am an undergraduate in Computer Science at University of Washington, 
WA. I am interested in data science and want to work in this field after
graduating. Therefore, the DSSG program becomes a valuable opportunity
for me to gain some experience on data science programming, and to learn
how to collaborate with other scientists in this field.

My assigned project is Global Sidewalk, where I learned a lot on how to
outline an project over the week. I worked on AccessMap project last
Spring quarter, which helps me to have a better understanding on what
this project is about and what my role in this project is. However, everyone
in this program seems professional and skillful, so there is still a lot
for me to learn.

I am very excited to work on this project and I wish we could achieve
all our goals at the end :)
