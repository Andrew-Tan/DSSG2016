This is a [Jekyll][jekyll] blog. You can set up blog posts like this one, by
adding a markdown just like this one to the `_posts` directory in [this repo](https://github.com/uwescience/DSSG2016), and
by having the addition of that file be merged into the `gh-pages` branch of this
repo (note that this repo does not have a `master` branch!).

You can do things like insert an image

![An image]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/profile.png)
